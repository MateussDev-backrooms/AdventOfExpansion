# What is this?
This is a Minecraft datapack that aims to Expand the current content of Advent of Ascension v3.6.11 for Minecraft 1.16.5
It is a small side-project of mine, where I experiment with JSON and datapack creation, as well as general Minecraft building and landscaping skills

# Why does this exist?
The whole reason I made this datapack is because I found the dimensions in Aoa3 lacking, even for old mod standards. And I decided why not try my shot at improving the generation in my own way that I found cool and interesting
My plan is to overhaul every single dimension to include:
- Custom trees/decorations
- New biomes
- Improved visuals
- Better landscapes
- Improved existing structures
- Refined but not majorly changed gameplay

# How do I play this?
It's simple! You just press the big green Code <> button at the top and download this as a .zip file. 
Then drag **the folder inside of the zip folder (If you just drag the downloaded .zip it will not register as a datapack, as the datapack is inside of a folder inside of the zip :P)** it into a world's datapack folder, or load it on world creation (recommended because the transition from old chunks to new chunks is rough)
In theory this datapack should work on any existing world too, you just have to venture far into new chunks to see the new generation

# What's in the datapack currently
This datapack is **UNFINISHED**, only containing improvements for these dimensions:

# Requirements
- Advent of Ascention v3.6.11
- (optional) Embeddium/Rubidium for better performance

**NOTE: Due to the generation changes the dimensions will load much slower/have lag on older/lower spec devices. Not as bad as Amplified mode, but be wary of lag**
